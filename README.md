# Aspiring Data Analyst

I have 3.3 years of experience in ETL testing at Accenture with extensive use of SQL. My love to work on data pushed me to pursue a master's in Data Science and now I'm looking forward to graduate from University College Dublin by the month of September.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning MongoDB
